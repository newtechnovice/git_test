✅ Foundation 
Elements on an HTML page are just information wrapped in an 
opening and closing HTML tags. 

Paragraph element:

<p> insert content here </p>
⬆           ⬆           ⬆
opening     content       closing

There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tags
called empty elements because they don't wrap any content. 

📝 Semantic HTML:
Using correct tags can help sites rank better in search engines
and make them accessible to users relying on assistive tech. 

📝 Always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of your
website index.html because web servers by dafault will look for it 
when users land on your website.


✅ Working with Text
- Using the correct level of heading is important as levels provide
a hierarchy to the content; h1 heading for overall page, lower
headings for content in smaller sections of the page.

- <strong> bold </strong> semantically marks text as important and 
affects assistive tools like screen readers.

- <em> italic </em> semantically places emphasis on text

- <!-- --> comment

📝 Use indentation to make the level of nesting clear and readable; it
is recommended to indent any child elements by 2 spaces.
